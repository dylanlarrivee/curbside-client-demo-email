# Curbside Notification App - Client Demo Email Campaign ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=dylanlarrivee.curbside-client-demo-email)

HTML / CSS email campaign that will be used to showcase the functionality of our Curbside Notification app. This email will represent an "Order Ready for Pickup" type email that a client might send out and allow the user to click through a "Pickup Now" module to get to the customer portion of the app.

## Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and hosted in [Oracle Responsys](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/cross-channel-orchestration/) marketing software.

## Purpose
This form can be linked from an "Order Ready" type of email or SMS message to give customers the option to alert a store clerk that they are ready and waiting for their curbside oder to be brought out. This form works along side the store clerk Curbside Notification App that I built which is what is displayed inside the store and features a near real time, queue based messaging system.

The best way to experience how the Curbside Notification App will work as a whole (customer + store clerk apps) you should also have open the store clerk version of the app where you can see the orders populating in near real time. The demo for that is available [here](https://curbside-demo.shawscottapps.com/signin) and you can log in with the username: DemoUser999 password: 1234
